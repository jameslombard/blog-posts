**Decentralise, Trust, Simplify**

## Decentralisation & Trustless Systems

https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/trustless

The problem as I see it: The problem is not in a central authority necessarily being the source of trust or truth, but rather emerges from the way decision making and responsibility works. Even though one may have some system of representational government which makes decisions through unanimous consensus, typically there is still some form of executive decision making mechanism required which takes responsibility for the decision and its consequences. The problem with a trustless system is that this responsibility is distributed or shared across the system, which makes accountability harder to pin-point and uphold. Perhaps it is therefore the immutable nature of the blockchain and not its distributed nature, which is most valuable for creating trust in a system. However, if there is a central authority which governs and administers the system, then they can override the immutability of the information, since they have all the power. 

"When it comes to money, centralized systems arguably have more widespread appeal than decentralized, trustless systems since people tend to be happier to direct trust towards organizations than systems. However, while organizations are made up of people who are easily corruptible, trustless systems can be governed entirely by computer code."

When is manual intervention and human discretion, despite its fallibility, required? What can be automated and what should not be automated?

## Distributed Ledgers vs. Blockchain

## Private vs. Permissioned

## Smart contracts

Core of contract law:

"Promise/performance given in exchange for promise/performance." - Lawrence Lessig (Harvard Professor)

Terms of the contract:

- Expressed Terms: Performance for a Performance
- Implied Terms: Greater legal context for the expressed terms.

Implied terms are created by the law and gets imposed or wrapped around the delivery of the performance etc.
What do the implied terms imply: The legal system has an interest in your contract.

OR vs EE => State is in the middle. Enforce or punish.
Digital Contracts need to be compliant to the law.
Digital contracts are not just between private parties, they are between private parties and the state. We live in a society.
State is the essential agent of enforcement in the real world.
